\tagline{"I studied the ways of the dragons. Mostly I learned how to set punks like you on fire."}

Dragonfire Adepts are heroes (and villains) who wander around the world doing draconic things. Mostly this entails breathing on things to set them on fire or whatever. They have studied the powers of dragons - those fierce beasts that \sout{fly around terrorising the countryside} laze about like cats and collect shinies like magpies, the magical creatures that \sout{tower above cities} could actually sleep on your bed, generally.

Dragonfire Adepts are not born, they are taught. You don't just appear as a dragonfire adept because one of your ancestors needs to go to prison, they actually sit down and decide to learn how to be awesome, like a Wizard or Fighter or Archivist. That said, many of them learn their ways on the job, and a large portion of the learning is always going to be via experience. They are almost compelled to "go out adventuring".

\textbf{Playing a Dragonfire Adept:} Constitution is awesome for your Hit Points, and more importantly for determining the Save DC of your Breath Weapon. However you can also find uses for Charisma - Spell-Like Abilities are keyed to it, and sometimes you want to talk at people. The other Ability Scores depend very much on what you want to do in particular. Dragonfire Adepts tend to take feats that either make their Breath Weapon more awesome, or that generally make them better at fighting such as Juggernaut and Elusive Target.

\textbf{Starting Wealth:} as Rogue

\classfeatures

\textbf{Weapon and Armour Proficiencies:} the Dragonfire Adept is proficient with Light and Medium Armour, but not with Shields of any kind. She is proficient with Simple and Natural Weapons, and one Martial or Exotic Weapon of choice. She is also proficient with any Armour or Shield that is specifically made out of dragon parts, and with any Intelligent Weapon. The Dragonfire Adept treats the Armor Check Penalty and Armor Stealth Penalty of Dragonscale Shirts, Dragonscale Plate, and Dragonscale Shields as if they were 4 better than normal.

\textbf{Dragon Breath (Su):} The Dragonfire Adept has a breath weapons. It can be used once per round as a standard action. It deals damage as listed on the chart, and prestige classes that enhance caster level or "other class features" also enhance the breath damage. The shape, effect, and saving throw allowed can vary (see below) but the DC of the save is always 10 + half the Dragonfire Adept's level + their Constitution modifier. If the breath weapon deals damage, the save is for half damage. If the breath weapon inflicts some other special effect then the save negates the effect. A Dragonfire Adept's breath weapon can be modified by Metabreath feats by simply adding a delay where there wouldn't normally be one.

\textbf{Energy Type (Su):} At first level the Dragonfire Adept's breath weapon can deal only a single energy type of damage. At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level they gain an additional energy type option. The type of energy used determines the type of save against the damage. Pick from the following list:
\begin{itemize*}
\item Acid (fortitude)
\item Cold (fortitude)
\item Electric (reflex)
\item Fire (reflex)
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Cone Breath (Su):} At first level a Dragonfire Adept's breath weapon is always a Clone ranged Cone.

\textbf{Draconic Mind (Ex):} the Dragonfire Adept sees the world in a similar way to how dragons see it. As a result, she gains (Dragon) as a subtype, and counts as a dragon whenever it would be beneficial to do so (activating magic items or magic rituals, etc). She also gains an Insight Bonus to Appraise, Knowledge and Spellcraft checks of +1 per 3 hit dice (round up), and gains Low-Light Vision, and 120ft Darkvision. At 6 hit dice, this will become 250ft Darkvision and 120ft Blindsense and Tremorsense. At 12 hit dice, this becomes 500ft Darkvision, 250ft Blindsense and Tremorsense, and 120ft Blindsight.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities I (Sp):} at level two, the Dragonfire Adept can cast the following once each per day: Darkness, Light, Water Breathing, Ventriloquism, Ghost Sound, Command, Fog Cloud, Speak With Animals, Bless, and Spider Climb. The caster level equals her hit dice, and the Save DC is 10 + half her hit dice + her Charisma Bonus.

\textbf{Line Breath (Su):} At 3rd level a Dragonfire Adept can their breath weapon as a Medium ranged Line.

\textbf{Legacy Secret:} at levels three, nine and fifteen, the Dragonfire Adept may select a Legacy Secret, a special power that is unlocked. Each one provides some special abilities at level three, level nine, and level fifteen.

\begin{itemize*}
\item \textbf{Dragon Body:} the Dragonfire Adept gains a Primary Bite (1d6+Str for a Medium character), a Primary Tail (1d8+Str*1.5 for a Medium character) and two Secondary Claws (1d4+Str*0.5 for a Medium character). These are all actually magic weapons with an Enhancement Bonus of +1 per 3 hit dice (round up). At level nine, the Dragonfire Adept gains an enhancement bonus to Strength equal to +1 per 3 hit dice (round up) and the damage dice of all her natural attacks improves by one stage (as if they had gained a size category). At level fifteen the Dragon Body attacks gain a 19-20 threat range, and her natural attack damage improves by another stage.
\item \textbf{Mighty Wings:} the Dragonfire Adept gains two Secondary Wing attacks (1d4+Str*0.5 for a Medium character) and a Flight speed of double her land speed with (Poor) maneuverability. At level nine, the flight speed becomes three times her land speed and it improves to (Average) maneuverability. At level fifteen it improves to four times her land speed with (Good) maneuverability.
\item \textbf{Master of Exhalations:} the Dragonfire Adept can leave a number of 5' square "gaps" in her breath area equal to her hit dice, to save allies from death. At level nine she can ??? \todo{replace missing Exultation spells}
\item \textbf{Disciple of Bahamut:} the Dragonfire Adept has a permanent Magic Circle Against Evil effect, can Detect Evil at will, and once per day can make her breath weapon Smiting: the Save DC increases by +4 against Evil targets, and the damage is increased by 50\% against Evil targets. At level nine, ??? \todo{replace missing Bahamut spells}
\item \textbf{Servant of Tiamat:} the Dragonfire Adept has a permanent Magic Circle Against Good effect and can Detect Good at will. At level nine, she can use two different breath weapons at the same time three times per day, though any overlaping area doesn't stack (a target in both areas is only affected by one of the breaths or the other, dragonfire adept's choice). At level fifteen this upgrades to three breath weapons at once, and it can be used five times per day. \todo{replace missing Tiamat spells}
\item \textbf{Visions of Lichdom:} the Dragonfire Adept already knows she wants to be a Dracolich. She has a pseudophylactery: some important item that is used as a focus, from which she can cast Magic Jar at will, but only on reptillian Animals with fewer hit dice than she has. At level nine, she becomes immune to Poison and Disease, and she can choose to release a rotting ichor breath weapon - instead of dealing damage, all in the area must pass a Fortitude Save or be Nauseated for 1 round per 5 dice of damage it deals (round up). At level fifteen, her type changes to Undead, gaining the [Dark Minded] Subtype. She can choose whether or not to also have the [Unliving] Subtype. Protip: Con scores are awesome.
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Dragon Age (Ex):} at level three, the Dragonfire Adept stops ageing completely. Bonuses and Penalties are no longer gained (and are retroactively lost), she doesn't visibly age, and she won't die of old age. Age-manipulating spells and effects have no effect on her. She is from this point on considered an Adult Dragon, regardless of age.

\textbf{Arcane Insight (Su):} at level four, the Dragonfire Adept gains a permanent Arcane Sight effect. With a Full Round Action she can cast Identify at will.

\textbf{Blast Breath (Su):} At 5th level a Dragonfire Adept can have their breath weapon affect a Blast within Medium range with a radius of 10ft + 5ft per 4 level (rounded up).

\textbf{Dragoncraft (Ex):} the fifth-level Dragonfire Adept can simply make stuff out of dead dragons as though it were no big deal. She effectively has Craft Magic Arms and Armour, but only for the purpose of making magic Dragonscale Armour and Shields, or weapons from dragon bones. She needn't supply any actual spells or experience for this, merely the dragon parts, half the item value in components, and time.

\textbf{Sphere Access:} at level six, the Dragonfire gains Basic Access to an Elemental Sphere. At level twelve, this improves to Advanced Access, and she gains Basic Access to another Elemental Sphere. At level eighteen, she gains Basic Access to another Elemental Sphere, and the first Sphere's access upgrades to Expert.

\textbf{Spread Breath (Su):} At 7th level the Dragonfire Adept's breath attack can be a Close ranged Spread centered on the Dragonfire Adept (though not including them).

\textbf{Scales I (Ex):} at level seven, the Dragonfire Adept develops special scales. She gains an Enhancement Bonus to Natural Armour of +1 per 3 hit dice (round up), and gains Resistance to Fire, Cold, Electricity and Acid equal to her hit dice.

\textbf{Dragon Body (Ex):} at 8th level a Dragonfire Adept becomes immune to Sleep and Paralysis effects.

\textbf{Booming Breath (Su):} at level ten, the Dragonfire Adept can make her breath weapon deal Sonic damage. This can be unleashed either as a massive boom that requires a Fortitude Save for half, or a high pitched keening that requires a Will Save for half.

\textbf{Exhalation Enhancement (Su):} at level ten, the Dragonfire Adept can add an annoying rider or bonus to the elemental breath weapons:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Fire: targets that fail their saving throw catch fire, make a Dispel attempt against all [Cold] effects in the area
\item Cold: targets that fail their saving throw are Slowed for one round, all water in the area is subject to a Freezing Sphere effect
\item Electricity: targets that fail their save are Entangled for one round
\item Acid: damage completely ignores Hardness and deals the full amount to objects, targets that fail their save are Sickened for one minute
\item Sonic: the Booming option causes a Shatter effect on all objects, and those who fail the save are Deafened for one minute. Those who fail to save against the Keening option Panic for 1 round.
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities II (Sp):} at level eleven, the Dragonfire Adept can cast the following once each per day: Dominate Person, Control Winds, Geas, Wall of Stone, Detect Thoughts, Wall of Ice, Plant Growth, Hallucinatory Terrain. The caster level equals her hit dice, and the Save DC is 10 + half her hit dice + her Charisma Bonus.

\textbf{Concussive Breath (Su):} at level thirteen, the Dragonfire Adept gains the ability to deal Force damage with her breath weapon. This does not benefit from Exhalation Enhancement, though it's super effective against ghosts.

\textbf{Scales II (Ex):} at level fourteen, the Dragonfire Adept's scales, which were developed from research and study, are even better. The Enhancement Bonus to Natural Armour is also added as a Resistance Bonus to Saving Throws, and the Energy Resistances are doubled.

\textbf{Shadow Breath (Su):} at level fourteen, the Dragonfire Adept can choose to exhale shadowy darkness. Instead of dealing damage with a save for half, this deals 1 negative level for every 10 dice of damage it would deal (round down), with a Fortitude Save to negate. The negative levels will go away on their own in an hour, but can still be deadly right now. Yes, Empowering the Breath means more dice which can then be converted into more negative levels.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities III (Sp):} at level sixteen, the Dragonfire Adept can cast the following once each per day: Dominate Monster, Control Weather. The caster level equals her hit dice, and the Save DC is 10 + half her hit dice + her Charisma Bonus.

\textbf{Gaseous Breath (Su):} at level seventeen, the Dragonfire Adept may release a special gas for the breath weapon. It deals no damage, but all in the area must pass a Will Save or have one of the following occur:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Fall Asleep for one round per five damage dice (round up)
\item Be Paralyzed for one round per five damage dice (round up)
\item Panic for one round per five damage dice (round up)
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Final Dragon Age (Ex):} at level eighteen, the Dragonfire Adept is considered a Great Wyrm for the purpose of any obscure crap that is based on age categories. This also means she can take Epic Feats as long as she otherwise meets the requirements.

\textbf{Draconic Immunities (Ex):} at level nineteen, the Dragonfire Adept becomes immune to one Energy Type of her choice. She may choose to, instead of the Energy Type, be immune to something roughly as common like [Compulsion] effects or [Death] effects or whatever.

\textbf{Annihilating Breath (Su):} at level twenty, the Dragonfire Adept can choose to have her breath weapon deal damage that doesn't have an energy type. This still counts as magical damage, and so ignores Damage Reduction. It also ignores Regeneration. If the target is reduced to zero or fewer hit points, they are utterly disintegrated.

\textbf{Sorcerous Secrets:} at level twenty, the Dragonfire Adept is so awesome that she can actually form Dragon Pacts: as the dragon in the relationship. Also, she knows how to do whatever is necessary to die in a draconic way: she can become the possessing entity of a graveyard thing, or make a Phylactery and become a Dracolich, or just go and get killed by adventurers or whatever.
